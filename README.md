# lowdefy-eventlistener-test
Quick example to test eventlisteners added via JsAction

## How to reproduce
If you select a file at first you will see a ```console.log()``` message. If you however select an option at the ```MultipleSelector``` field 
the eventlistener gets removed from the file input and therefore you won't see any log output anymore when selecting a file after that.
